# Organizations

An Organization is the representation of a Group of People

## Administration
Every organization has Multiple Roles. One of these is an Admin.

The Admin can manage the Organization and configure it to the Desired State.

They can manage :

* [Members](members.md) and their permissions
* [Recurring Shifts](recurring.md) for recurring shift tasks
* [Shift Templates](shift_templates.md) for common Shift Layouts
* [Shift Types](shift_types.md) for categorizing member activity

## Shift Summary
All Member Activity is summarized by Shift Type and Timeframe. Details are contained in the [Summary Section](shift_summary.md)
